Hey now, the second row is my fallback row!
Dammit
Not bad clearing out some edges form the second row
Come on now, I'm trying to keep these edges in double digits #Lol
Next time try for the third row or lower #EmoteFlustered
Nooooo I like the second row #EmoteFlustered
Next time try for a lower number #Lol
That was high enough that I still didn't want to lose it #EmoteFlustered
Not bad you lucky bastard #Lol
Awww I kinda wanted that one
Sucks to see that one go #EmoteFlustered
Come on, leave the second row alone #Lol
Noo that's from my fallback row
Awwww damn
Oh well, you win some you lose some
Damn I would have liked to keep that one
I wanted that one to stick around #EmoteFlustered
Could have done better, but still pretty lucky
Booo
I want a redo please #EmoteFlustered
Just try to pick out edges from the bottom two rows in the future #Lol
Awww can I have that one back?
At least it wasn't from the top row #EmoteFlustered
Lucky fucker #Lol
