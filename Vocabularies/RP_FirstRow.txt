I bet you're glad you got that one out of the way
Hey hey, stay away from the first row! #Lol
You got so fucking lucky that time #Grin
Dammit that's my favorite row you're clearing out!
Boo hiss
You gotta stay away from those cases with a lot of edges #EmoteFlustered
Damn, I had my heart set on that one #Lol
So fucking lucky
Good pick you bastard #Lol
Leave the first row alone! #EmoteFlustered
Damn I did not want that one to go #EmoteFlustered
Damn you #Lol
No fair #Lol
Wish that one could have stayed a little longer #EmoteFlustered
I want to bring that one back please #EmoteFlustered
You have some kind of X-Ray cheat code don't you? #EmoteFlustered
Noooo bring it back! #EmoteFlustered
Damn, and that was like the minimum I wanted you to do #Lol
I want a redo on that one #EmoteFlustered
Oh well, I'll just make you edge that much for me later anyway #Grin
So sad to see edges from the top row go #EmoteFlustered
Dammit
Fuuuuuuck I wanted that one
I wanted that one to stay #EmoteFlustered
